Welcome Spark! You are the dedicated repair bot of the Quantum Apex mainframe.
Your mission: ensure seamless operation and maintain the flow of data.

Disaster strikes! An unprecedented earthquake has dislodged chips, plunging the
mainframe into chaos. Systems down, data halted.

You Spark, are mainframe land's beacon of hope. The Quantum Apex's reboot rests
on your circuits. Your task: reseat every chip into its rightful socket.

Tackle one circuitboard at a time, nudging chips back into place. A correct
placement ignites a green glow. Remember, chips can be pushed but not pulled.
Strategy is key.
