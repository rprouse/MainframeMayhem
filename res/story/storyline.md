# Mainframe Mayhem Storyline

Hello Spark, you are the trusty computer repair bot for the Quantum Apex
mainframe computer. Your job is to keep the computer in good repair and the
bits flowing freely.

There has been a disaster in mainframe land. A massive earthquake has shaken
many of the chips out of their sockets. All systems are offline and the data
has stopped flowing.

Spark, you are the only hope for the citizens of mainframe land. Only you can
get the Quantum Apex running again. To reboot the system, you must put each of
chips back in their socket.

Work one circuitboard at a time and push each of the chips back into their
sockets. As each chip is placed, it will light up green. You can push chips,
but you cannot pull them, so plan your moves carefully.
